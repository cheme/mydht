# Implementing MyDHT tunnel

In last post we give some thought on tunnel and mydht interaction and conclude that a mydht implementation specific to tunnel should be build (and in a second time use it in a transport).

- make peer update sendable to global service (see traint PeerStatusListener).
- write test case first
