mydht-bencode
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cheme/mydht-bencode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cheme/mydht-bencode)


MyDHT library for encoding message as binary encode (external dependency to bencode).


Build
-----

Use [cargo](http://crates.io) tool to build and test.

Status
------

This is currently not used in real case, but the code is simple enought to be trusted.
Plus all is in memory (no stream in crate), so bincode is recommended.
TODO minimal testcases.
