mydht-fs
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cheme/mydht-fs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cheme/mydht-fs)


MyDHT usage example.

It implements a filestore, it is means to be a demo with as many option as possible (see json conf). This lead to a big binary and some useless config case.

It could be use as a sample.
By removing some macro logic it could be use to build a simple filestore with decent size and compile time.

Test example is a remnant of main from mydht moved here for convenience.

Usage
-----

TODO describe conf and retest it.

All current restriction to mydht applies here (tcp transport local only...)

Build
-----

Use [cargo](http://crates.io) tool to build and test.

Status
------

WIP
